A 5-layer NN with hundred hidden nodes per layer was built, which gave an accuracy of 85% on the training set, but only around 45-50% on test set. Adding more layers made the overfitting worse, while lesser layers/higher regularization made it underfit the data. The confusion matrix, and another experiment performed by building binary classifiers for each pair of genres revealed that the data was noisy, with several genres being confused for each other (as can be seen in Database.csv, and in the PCA results). Also, the number of examples varied vastly between genres, which also skewed the classification.
I think that in order to achieve a better acuracy, more data, or other features are required.
As an aside, a model was built on Azure ML studio, which gave a pretty high accuracy, but we were not able to recreate it using keras.
